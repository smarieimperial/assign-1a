# assign-1a
For this assignment we were asked to apply what we learned in class and create a Box Model, what that is according to W3 Schools, is referenced when creating the design of a layout, where boxes wrap around HTML elements.  These boxes contain margins, border, padding and content.

From doing this assignment I learned about use of space, padding, border widths, alignment and the use of breaking up content into sections.  At least how one can approach the varying ways of breaking up content into sections, while taking into account the traditional ways of using these sections and not getting too far away from best use procedures.  The first complete draft of this assignment took me 40 minutes, followed by another two sessions where I was able to fine tune smaller details and fix any small issues related to overflow or alignment of the boxes to replicate what the Box Model should look like based on the photo we were all given to use as a guide.
